    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three conclusions that really jump out, based on the sorting and kinds of analysis done here, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Larger schools produce lower pass rates\n",
    "  2. Charter schools produce higher pass rates\n",
    "  3. Budget seems to be *inversely* proportional to pass rate\n",
    "\n",
    "It's difficult to say to what extent each of these factors influences the pass rate, and how independent of one another they are.\n",
    "- Practically by definition, a charter school will be smaller than a public school, as it has an admissions cap. Charter schools being more successful *may* be less attributed to their status as charters and more attributed to the amount of attention each teacher can give to each of their students.\n",
    "- The charter schools all happened to have lower budgets than the public schools. Is this a function of their status as charters, or a function of the number of students they handle? Does it depend on the state? Public schools get more money per student as attendance increases, so it seems likely that public funds to charter schools would also do so. If that's the case, the best we can say on the budget is that it's irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable mention may be given to the fact that individual grade level seems to have no impact on students' grades; rather, it's the school itself that determines the effectiveness of the education.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, I think the only conclusion we can *truly* draw from this information is one that previous studies have long shown: the higher the number of students, the lower the effectiveness of learning for each student. The other variables seem too connected to student count to be able to be able to decouple student count's influence from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe if we had data on the number of teachers each school has (preferably per grade, though with grade levels being mostly irrelevant, we could do without that) we would be able to draw some conclusions on the teachers->school type, teachers->budget, and teachers->student count relationships to answer some of these questions.\n",

However, that leaves us with using the DataFrame constructor directly in order to combine them all, and then chaining it into an index reset.\n",
